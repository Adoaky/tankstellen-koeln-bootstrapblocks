# Bootstrap 4 Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress

## Templates

All blocks are implemented as [dynamic blocks](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/block-tutorial/creating-dynamic-blocks/).
This makes it possible to overwrite the template of a block in your theme.

To overwrite a block template create a folder called `bootstrap-blocks/` in your theme directory.
You can copy the original template from `bootstrap-blocks/src/templates/<blockname>.php` as a starting point and adjust it to your needs.

## Developer information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
